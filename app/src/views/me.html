              Hi. I am Francisco.<br>
              I studied graphic design and working as user experience designer during seven years.
            </h1>
            <p>
              Iâ€™m from Chile. My alma matter is the school of architecture and design of PUCV. Sometimes I put some thoughts in my writings, inspired by what I read in pocket, twitter and medium.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I started working in bigger digital systems, I realized that a service design approach is key to tackle the challenges we are facing nowadays. Since then, I have been studying by my own and putting in practice tools and methodologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my free time I love playing guitar, walking through Santiago and taking some photos.
